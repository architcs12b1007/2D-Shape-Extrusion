Babylon.js 2D Shape Extrusion and Manipulation

Goal: The goal of this assignment is to create a Babylon.js application that allows the user to draw arbitrary 2D shapes on the ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and then manipulate those objects by moving the object and editing their vertices using buttons for mode selection.

Instructions:

1- Click on 'DRAW BUTTON' to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane.
(Now, do left-click on the ground plane to add points (add minimum 3 points) ans then do right-click to complete the 2d shape).

2- Click on 'EXTRUDE BUTTOM' to initiate the extrusion process.
(Now do left click on the 2d object and it will extrude the 2d polygon shape to create a 3D shape)

3- Click on "MOVE BUTTON" to enable drag feature of extruded shape.
CLICK on "MOVE BUTTON" again in order to stop using this feature.(and also in case, if we want to use other feature)

4- Click on "Edit VERTEX BUTTON" and then do left click on extruded shape and it will display all the vertices of extruded shape.
Then, we can drag the vertices and it will change the shape of extruded object as per movement of vertices.

CLICK on "Edit VERTEX BUTTON" again in order to stop using this feature.(and also in case, if we want to use other feature)

How to Use:

1. Unzip the folder to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm: npm install

3. Start the development server: npm run dev

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the Babylon.js scene.

Technologies Used:

1. Babylon.js: A powerful 3D game engine and framework for web development.

2. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
